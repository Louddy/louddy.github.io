I am a PhD student in theoretical computer science at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München under the supervision of (Jasmin Blanchette)[https://www.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/mitarbeiter/jasmin-blanchette_de.html]. Previously, I completed my master's thesis in number theory at Université de Montréal under the supervision of Matilde Lalín. My research interests revolve around the applications of computer science to mathematical research.
